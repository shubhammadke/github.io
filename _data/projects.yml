      **Contributions:**
       
       - Designed an end-to-end sales data warehouse using Pentaho DI and performed various transformations on the data (Row Normalizer, Database Lookup, if field value is null)
       - Designed a database using Star Schema and built a multi-dimensional cube using Mondrian
       - Configured the Pentaho BI server to deploy reports by creating a database connection in Pentaho Enterprise Console for central usage. 
       - Also, conducted analysis using the inbuilt Saiku Analytics Plugin and created an interactive dashboard using Tableau to demonstrate the results using pie chart, bar graphs, data blending feature and bubble charts.
